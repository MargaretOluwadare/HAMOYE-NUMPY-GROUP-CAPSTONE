## INFORMATION CONTAINED HERE IS AS ADOPTED FROM https://zindi.africa/competitions/data-science-nigeria-challenge-1-loan-default-prediction
## TO GIVE INSIGHT TO THE DATA USED IN THE HSDC21-NUMPY GROUP CAPSTONE PROJECT

## Description
This challenge was designed bY HAMOYE HDSC20-NUMPY GROUP Nigeria specifically for the HDSC21-DATA SCIENCE internship. <br>

After the internship, this repo will remain open to allow others in the  community to learn and test their skills.<br>

## Description of the project:

SuperLender is a local digital lending company, which prides itself in its effective use of credit risk models to deliver profitable and high-impact loan alternative. Its assessment approach is based on two main risk drivers of loan default prediction:.<br>
1) willingness to pay and <br>
2) ability to pay. <br>

Since not all customers pay back, the company invests in experienced data scientist to build robust models to effectively predict the odds of repayment.

These two fundamental drivers need to be determined at the point of each application to allow the credit grantor to make a calculated decision based on repayment odds, which in turn determines if an applicant should get a loan, and if so - what the size, price and tenure of the offer will be.

There are two types of risk models in general: New business risk, which would be used to assess the risk of application(s) associated with the first loan that he/she applies. The second is a repeat or behaviour risk model, in which case the customer has been a client and applies for a repeat loan. In the latter case - we will have additional performance on how he/she repaid their prior loans, which we can incorporate into our risk model.

It is your job to predict if a loan was good or bad, i.e. accurately predict binary outcome variable, where Good is 1 and Bad is 0.
